# Econ Data Lens

The purpose of this project is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for accessing, analyzing, and visualizing public economic data. The platform is planned to represent the data in a more digestible format, making it easier for the general public, researches, and others to understand and utilize the information.

## Development
This project is at an early stage of planning and development. The initial focus is on building a robust ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to gather and process data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Other data sources will be considered in the future. 

This README will be updated as the project progresses.
